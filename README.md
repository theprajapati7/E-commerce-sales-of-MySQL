## 📂 Project Structure

- `ecommerce.sql` – SQL file to create the schema and populate tables with sample data.
- Sample queries covering:
  - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
  - `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
  - Subqueries
  - Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
  - Views for analysis
  - Indexes for query optimization
